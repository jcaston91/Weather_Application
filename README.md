# Weather_Application

This was one of my favorite projects that I did. It was one of the few times that I worked with an API. For this assignmet it is simple to explain. I connected to an API and cusotmized my calls to pull down what information that I wanted after the user input either a city or zipcode. I really enjoyed this project and would encourage everyone to take a shot at this project and customize it how you want.
